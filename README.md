# graphql-workshop

In this hands-on, one-day workshop you'll learn about all things GraphQL. You will learn what is special about GraphQL and why it's so popular nowadays. What problems does it actually solve and how does it help to make our apps more performant and easier to maintain. We will start by understanding major principles of GraphQL and core syntax of GraphQL query language. We will see how we can get all the data that we need on the client by just interacting with one single endpoint. We will discuss both barebones of interaction with this endpoint as well as different libraries options we can use. 

After learning how to query data that we need from the server by writing our own GraphQL queries, we will proceed to changing the data, submitting forms and finally we will see how real-time updates are handled by GraphQL client. 

We will also learn how to write your own GraphQL server in Node as well as use open source libraries/engines to help us with the process and auto generate GraphQL schema for us. 

But that's not all, we will also discuss more advanced topics such as authentication, error management and so on.


# Section 1 - Getting to know GraphQL

In this section we will learn GraphQL query language by experimenting with three different GraphQL endpoints implemented in a different way

# Section 2 - GraphQL server basics

In this section we will create our own Node server and reimplement one of the endpoints we've used in Section 1

In this section we will learn how to consume GraphQL in React app

# Section 4 - Learn about 3factor.app Architecture. Hasura and real time

We will learn about various Architecture patterns in GraphQL as well as how to use Hasura open source engine to auto generate GraphQL even for existing database

# Section 5 - Create a todo app from scratch by following step by step tutorial.
